      For Assignment 5, I created a circuit which allowed me to control an LED strip with an IR remote.

    <p>
      For the IR Remote sensor, I used the IRremote library:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/Arduino-IRremote/Arduino-IRremote">IRremote by shirriff, z3t0, ArminJo</a></li>
      </ul><br>
      The IRremote library allowed me to recieve button input from the remote, which allowed me to control the LED strip.
      This was controlled using the gate at with the transistor. 
      <br><br>
      The IR sensor is connected to the Arduino, which powers it at 5V. Looking at the datasheet for the IR sensor, it operates at a range
      of 0.4 to 1.5 mA. The LED strip and transistor, on the other hand, are connected to the power supply at 12V. One LED segment has a length
      of 5 cm. As the entire strip is 5 m, it means that there are 1000 segments in the total strip. Each segment has three white LEDs, meaning
      a total voltage drop of 9.9V. With a 12V power supply, then there is a 2.1V drop across the resistor. Using Ohm's law and the resistor value
      of 240 ohms, each LED segment has a current of 0.00875 A. As all segments are in parallel, the total current drawn is 8.75 A. This total amount
      then flows into the transistor. The transistor can handle a max current of 80 A, so this is okay. The transistor also recieves 0-5V at the
      gate, which is supplied by the PWM pin on the arduino. 
      <br><br>
      The following code was used for my cirtcuit:
    <pre>
      <code>
#define DECODE_NEC  1         // defines decoding protocol

#include &ltIRremote.h>        // IRremote by shirriff, z3t0, ArminJo: https://github.com/Arduino-IRremote/Arduino-IRremote

int LED_PIN = 5;              // pin attatched to transistor for LED strip
int IR_RECEIVE_PIN = 11;      // pin set to be infared input

bool ON_STATE = false;        // sets initial on state to be off
int BRIGHTNESS = 125;         // sets initial brightness to be 125


void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);         // sets serial monitor for a baud rate of 9600
  // [FROM CLASS CODE] prints file, date, and IRremote version number
  Serial.println(F("START " __FILE__ " from " __DATE__ "\r\nUsing library version " VERSION_IRREMOTE));

  IrReceiver.begin(IR_RECEIVE_PIN, ENABLE_LED_FEEDBACK);     // initializes sensor at specified pin

  Serial.print(F("Ready to receive IR signals at pin "));    // prints confirmation message
  Serial.println(IR_RECEIVE_PIN);                            // prints infrared pin number

  // there is no need to use pinMode as I am using analogWrite. However, when the pin is outputting 0V, the transistor
  // is not letting current flow. When it is 5V, it is allowing current.

  analogWrite(LED_PIN, 255);                                 // turns LED strip on initially to test functionality
  delay(1000);                                               // waits 1 second
  analogWrite(LED_PIN, 0);                                   // turns off LED
}

void loop() {
  // runs if sensor is recieving data
  if (IrReceiver.decode()) {

    // [FROM CLASS CODE] Prints summary of recieved data
    IrReceiver.printIRResultShort(&Serial);                     // Prints summary
    if (IrReceiver.decodedIRData.protocol == UNKNOWN) {         // Runs if protocol recieved is unknown
      IrReceiver.printIRResultRawFormatted(&Serial, true);      // Prints error message
    }
    Serial.println();                                           // Prints new line
    delay(200);                                                 // Delays 200ms to give time between button presses
    IrReceiver.resume();                                        // Allows for receiving of next value

    // runs if power, up, or down buttons are pressed
    if (IrReceiver.decodedIRData.command == 0x45) {             // if power button is pressed
      ON_STATE = !ON_STATE;                                     // turns power on/off
      Serial.println(ON_STATE);                                 // prints 
    } else if (IrReceiver.decodedIRData.command == 0x9) {       // if up button is pressed

        BRIGHTNESS+=25;                                         // increase brightness by 255
      }
      Serial.println(BRIGHTNESS);                               // prints brightness
    } else if (IrReceiver.decodedIRData.command == 0x7) {       // if down button is pressed
      if (BRIGHTNESS > 0) {                                     // as long as brightness is above 0
        BRIGHTNESS-=25;                                         // lowers brightness by 25
      }
      Serial.println(BRIGHTNESS);                               // prints brightness
    }
    
    BRIGHTNESS = constrain(BRIGHTNESS, 0, 255);                 // constrains brightness between 0 and 255

    if (ON_STATE) {                                             // if LED strip on state is true

            What is the absolute maximum amount of current between pins 2 and 3?
          </b><br>
          The highest amount of current between pins 2 (drain) and 3 (source) is 80 A
          with a pulsed current. If the current is continuous, the maxiumum current is
          37.2 A. <br>
