      For Assignment 1, I created a circuit which blinks three LEDs separately.
      I used a green, white, and red LED and programmed them to blink in succcession.
      I began first by calculating the resistance needed to each LED.

    <p>
      The red and green LEDs contain a voltage drop of 1.8V, thus using Ohm's law,
      the resistance needed to achieve a current of 20mA would be 160Ω. Rounding up to
      avoid overloading the LED, I used a 220Ω resistor. The white LED had a 3.3V drop,
      meaning it required an 85Ω resistance. Rounding up, I used a 100Ω resistor for the white.

      In my drawn schematic, each LED is supplied voltage from the digital output pin.
      The current is limited by a resistor, allowing the LED to turn on. The following code was used
      to blink each LED: <br>
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
   // initializes digital pins as output
   void setup() {
     pinMode(13, OUTPUT);   // initializes pin 13 as output
     pinMode(12, OUTPUT);   // initializes pin 12 as output
     pinMode(11, OUTPUT);   // initializes pin 11 as output
   }

   // method to blink LEDs; takes two variables
   // num = pin number
   // time = time between actions, defaults to 250 ms 
   void blink(int num, int time = 250) {
     digitalWrite(num, HIGH);   // turns LED on
     delay(time);   // waits specified amount of time
     digitalWrite(num, LOW);   // turns LED off
     delay(time);    // waits specified amount of time
   }

   // loops program repeatedly
   void loop() {
     blink(13);   // blinks LED at pin 13
     blink(12);   // blinks LED at pin 12
     blink(11);   // blinks LED at pin 11
   }
      </code>

    <h2>Questions:</h2>

        <li>
          If you were to use every single digital pin (0-13), you would be able to blink
          14 LEDs with the arduino. As each LED is blinking independently, the current would depend
          on the LED and resistor. For red, yellow, and green LEDs with a 220Ω resistor, the current
          would be 14.5mA. Blue, white, and pink LEDs with a 100Ω resisitor would have a current of 17mA.
        </li>
        <li>N/A</li>
        <li>
          Based on empirical observations, a delay of about 3ms will make the LEDs appear
          as if they are no longer blinking.
