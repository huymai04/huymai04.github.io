      For Assignment 2, I created a cirtcuit in which pressing a button caused three
      LEDs to blink and fade. I used digitalRead with the button to activate the LEDs.

    <p>
      The button circuit is connected to the 5V power source on the Arduino. Pin 13
      is reading input, and measures whether or not the cirtcuit is closed. A 10kÎ© resisitor
      is used to limit the current when the button is pressed. 10k is high enough to limit
      the current, but not high enough to affect the button.
      <br>
      <br>
      I chose to use two blue and one white LEDs. As all three LEDs have a voltage drop of
      3.3V, the same resistor value is used (calculation show below). They are connected to pins 3, 5, and 6 as they are
      PWM pins for using analogWrite.

      When the button is pressed and completes the input circuit, it activates my code which uses the three output pins to
      blink and fade the LEDs. The following code was used to blink each LED: <br>

    <pre>
      <code>
// initializes pins as output/input
void setup() {
  pinMode(13, INPUT);   // initializes pin 13 to take input from button loop
  pinMode(6, OUTPUT);   // initializes pin 6 for blue LED
  pinMode(5, OUTPUT);   // initializes pin 5 for white LED
  pinMode(3, OUTPUT);   // initializes pin 3 for blue LED
}

// method to fade LED using analogWrite; takes 3 variables: pin, bright, and fade
// pin: int representing which pin to be used for output
// bright: int representing initial LED brightness; defaults to 15
// fade: int representing increment that LED brightness increases; defaults to 5
void fade(int pin, int bright = 15, int fade = 5) {
  while (bright <= 255) {         // while brightness is below/at 255, run loop
    analogWrite(pin, bright);     // sets LED brightness through output with pin and bright variables
    bright = bright + fade;       // increases bright by fade amount
    delay(20);                    // wait 20 seconds
  }
  analogWrite(pin, 0);            // resets LED to 0 brightness after loop is completed
}

// method to blink LED using digitalWrite; takes 2 variables: pin, wait
// pin: int representing which pin to be used for output
// wait: int representing delay in ms; defaults to 50ms
void blink(int pin, int wait = 50) {
  digitalWrite(pin, HIGH);        // turns LED on at passed pin
  delay(wait);                    // waits passed delay time
  digitalWrite(pin, LOW);         // turns LED off
}

// runs repeatedly
void loop() {
  int buttonState = digitalRead(13);  // reads if input pin is HIGH/LOW and assigns to buttonState
  if (buttonState == HIGH) {          // if buttonState is HIGH (pressed)
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {     // for loop running twice; blinks all LEDs rapidly
      blink(6);                       // calls blink method to blink LED connected to pin 6
      blink(5);                       // calls blink method to blink LED connected to pin 5
      blink(3);                       // calls blink method to blink LED connected to pin 3
      delay(50);                      // delays 50 ms
    }
    fade(6);                          // calls fade method to fade LED at pin 6
    fade(5);                          // calls fade method to fade LED at pin 5
    fade(3);                          // calls fade method to fade LED at pin 3
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {     // same for loop as above- runs twice and blinks all LEDs rapidly
      blink(6);                       // calls blink method to blink LED connected to pin 6
      blink(5);                       // calls blink method to blink LED connected to pin 5
      blink(3);                       // calls blink method to blink LED connected to pin 3
      delay(50);                      // delays 50 ms
    }
  } else {                            // if buttonState is LOW (not pressed)
    analogWrite(6, 0);                // keeps LED at pin 6 off
    analogWrite(5, 0);                // keeps LED at pin 5 off
    analogWrite(3, 0);                // keeps LED at pin 3 off
  }

        <li>
          Assuming the LED has a voltage drop of 3.3V:

        </li>
        <li>
          Assuming all 3 LEDs were on at once, the battery would power the circuit for
          23.53 hours.
