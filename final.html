                <h2>Project Concept & Motivation</h2>
                <p>
                    I have two cats at home, Moe and Saya. They frequently go outside, and they come and go
                    using a cat door in our garage. Unfortunately, there is no lock on the door, meaning animals
                    such as the other cats, mice, or even racoons can come into through the door to steal food.
                    For my final project, I wanted to build a cat door lock that is unlocked by an RFID tag that
                    I would place on my cats' collars.
                </p>
                <img class="container-img" loading="lazy" src="assets/final/proposal.jpeg">
                <p>
                    I planned on placing the sensor outside the door, connected to a servo motor on the inside that
                    would control a bar blocking the swinging door. When the correct RFID tag was brought to the sensor,
                    it would beep and flash a light, lifting the bar and allowing the door to push through. I planned the
                    LED and beep for visual and audio feedback, allowing me to use the stimuli to train my cats to enter
                    through the door. While I planned to use a higher strength material for the bar in future iterations, I
                    built my final project prototype out of cardboard due to time contraints.
                </p>

                <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
                <img class="container-img" loading="lazy" src="assets/final/schem.jpeg">
                <p>
                    There were four aspects of my circuit: the RFID sensor, LED, buzzer, and servo motor. Following the
                    <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/mfrc522/">MFRC522 library documentation</a>, I
                    connected the sensor to my arduino. Unlike previous components in this course, the sensor was connected
                    to 3.3V.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The LED circuit was fairly straightforward and resembled that from work on previous assignments.
                    Using Ohm's Law, the ideal resistor would be 160Ω to maintain a current of 20mA. I used the next highest
                    reisstor at 220Ω.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The buzzer was similar to the LED, only without the resistor. Setting the output pin as HIGH resulted in
                    the beeping sound from the buzzer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The servo motor was connected to 5V pin and was controlled by the PWM pin on the arduino. I used the
                    <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/servo/">Servo library</a> to access and write
                    to the Servo.
                </p>

                <h2>Building</h2>
                <img class="container-img" loading="lazy" src="assets/final/0.1.gif">
                <p>
                    I started by building an open version of my circuit without the servo motor. This allowed me to complete
                    the portion of recognizing the correct RFID tag.
                </p>
                <img class="container-img" loading="lazy" src="assets/final/0.2.jpg">
                <p>
                    I then fit the circuitry inside a cardboard enclosure which would allow me to neatly use my product. I cut
                    and joined cardboard, leaving an opening at the bottom for power and the servo wire. 
                </p>
                <img class="container-img" loading="lazy" src="assets/final/0.3.gif">
                <p>
                    Lastly, I connected the servo motor to the circuit and ensured that the RFID sensor could read the tag through
                    the cardboard. I had to switch the original piece of cardboard to a thinner one that allowed for higher sensitivity,
                    but I was able to get the prototype to function.
                </p>
